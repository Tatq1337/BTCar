# BTCar


Simple bluetooth contlored car using arudino uno. 4 motors are connected to l298n borad. BT module is connected to arduino uno. Using phone and application like 'arduino bluetooth car' from apple store / google play you can control motors. You just have to connect your phone to BT module. 

*Bare in mind that aplication that I used was sending throught serial strings like "L / R / F / B" it can be diffrent in your aplication.
